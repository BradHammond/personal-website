            <h1 class="red">Megapixel Ideas</h1>
            <p>Megapixel Ideas is my freelance web development company. I needed a website to showcase my abilities, portfolio and various offerings. The Megapixel Ideas website has gone through several changes.</p>
            <p>At its creation, I used Megapixel Ideas to promote mobile applications that I have created. The first iteration of the website was a promotional page for mobile apps. Currently the Megapixel Ideas website is in its third iteration, primarily focusing on web development services.</p>

            <h1 class="purple">Christ Explained</h1>
            <p>Christ Explained is a non-profit organization that writes about Christian-based topics and distributes free Bibles across the globe. I was tasked with creating a website that was simple to navigate and reader-centric. </p>
            <p>I designed this website with reading in mind and it is easy to read content whether you are on a desktop or mobile device. Overall this was a very different project and had goals that would be similar to a web application rather than a straightforward marketing website.</p>

            <h1 class="darkBlue">Alpine Baptist Church</h1>
            <p>Alpine Baptist Church needed a new and updated website that would reflect their current mission, provide access to updated resources and that would encourage people to come in and visit.</p>
            <p>I started with their old website's content as a basis for the new website but completely redesigned the new site from the ground up. This was a small simple project that was a lot of fun and very rewarding.</p>

            <h1 class="green">Luci</h1>
            <p>Luci is a startup company that is part social media platform, part daily deal service. Luci was in the process of developing a mobile application and needed a designer to work through different ideas, designs and prototypes.</p>
            <p>I handled user experience research, user experience design, wire-framing, prototyping, illustration, logo design and user interface design. I was able to create a brand identity and application design that Luci's development team can use to launch a viable application.</p>
